                    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <p>This story begins when my ship experienced massive uncontrollable acceleration.  Initially this posed no problem, I was in interstellar space and knew enough to fix anything on my ship.  I already suspected the problem was the cheap <span title="really important part" id="problemPart">TR-59x</span> I had bought for ‚Çª54.999 in that alley back on StarPlanetB.</p>
                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>What had started as a small problem eventually became a big problem.  It took me almost a week to get the faulty <span title="really important part" id="problemPart">TR-59x</span>, diagnose it, and replace it.  During that time however my velocity had increased massively.  I guess a week of accelerating acceleration will do that.  By the time I had everything fixed I was traveling nearly &frac12; the speed of light!</p>
                    <h2>The <strong><em>REAL</em></strong> Problem</h2>
                    <p>I am no stranger to going fast.  I still hold records for fastest transit in at least a dozen galaxies.  But this was different.  When I went to the control panel to performed a retrograde burn, this is what I saw:
            <pre><samp>        StarOS Release 5.5.1 embedded_light_drive_16_bit
            WARNING: tr driver failed to connect: /‚Ç∑s/x3‚èß4@345sd‚öõ
            WARNING: tr access to device disabled
            bash-2.05b# </samp><kbd>./retrograde.sh 100% 15m</kbd>
            <samp>Attempting retrograde burn for 15 minutes at 100%
            ERROR: light drive is offline üëé
            EXITING
            bash-2.05b#
            </samp></pre>
                    <p>Now this was the <strong>real</strong> problem.  This means that while replacing the <span title="really important part" id="problemPart">TR-59x</span> I had corrupted the software driver for the light drive and now I had no communications with the drive from the control panel.  My acceleration would continue.</p>
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>If you have one contact me at my address....I'll be waiting.  Hopefully some skilled devs read this post and can write me a new driver.</p>
